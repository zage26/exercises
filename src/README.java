	 * EXERCISE ONE -- STATUS: COMPLETE
	 	Q: Which version of merge do you prefer?
	 	A: I prefer the object method as it is less writing, 
    	and you are more easily able to use the method readily 
	 * 
	 * EXERCISE 2 -- STATUS: COMPLETE
	 * Task: Transform the following class method into an object method
	 * Adjusted Code:
	 * 		public double abs(Complex c) {
				return Math.sqrt(c.real * c.real + c.imag * c.imag);
			}
	 * Note: The keyword static is removed.
	 * 		 Now, this code can be used on any object of the class created
	 * 
	 * EXERCISE 3 -- STATUS: COMPLETE
	 * Task: Transform the following object method into a class method.
	 * Adjusted Code:
	 * 		public static boolean equals(Complex b) {
				return(real == b.real && imag == b.imag);
			}
	 * Note: The keyword static is added.
	 * 		 Now, this code can be used on the class itself. 
	 * 
	 * EXERCISE 4 -- Parts 1, 2, and 3, STATUS: COMPLETE
	 	Q: Think about the pros and cons of class and object methods. Which
		  is more concise (usually)?
		A: A class object only works on the general class created,
		   whereas an object method works on all of the instances
		   of that class created. In general, if a method could be 
		   broadly used to meet the specifications of any class, I 
		   believe a class method should be used, however for certain
		   specific scenarios, such as receiving a specific boolean value
		   or number that could only be handles by a specific method, 
		   object methods are better. 
	 * 
	 * EXERCISE 5 -- Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 (Note: Sadly, I did not get 
	 * 				 anything that was good), 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 STATUS: COMPLETE
	 * 				*However, probably improvement needed* 
	 * 
	 * Note: As you know, I had a bit of a time crunch today, and was not able to 
	 * dully revise all of my code, I wrote the outline however if possible 
	 * would greatly appreciate more time to further understand, better, and 
	 * make sure I have fully functioning code.
